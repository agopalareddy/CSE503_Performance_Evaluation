# Web Server Performance Evaluation

## Overview

This repository contains performance evaluation experiments comparing Apache and Nginx web servers on AWS EC2. The experiments were conducted as part of the final project for Washington University in St. Louis's CSE 503S: Rapid Prototyping and Creative Programming course.

## Repository Structure

### Test Scripts
- `files/prime_test.js` - JavaScript implementation of prime number calculation
- `files/prime_test.py` - Python implementation of prime number calculation
- `files/test.html` - HTML test page

### Results
- `files/apache_results_1000.txt` - Apache benchmark results
- `files/nginx_results_1000.txt` - Nginx benchmark results
- `files/performance_comparison.png` - Visual comparison of results
- A couple of CSV files containing raw performance data from python and nginx program runs

### Documentation
- `report.pdf` - Comprehensive performance evaluation report

## Environment

Tests were conducted on an AWS EC2 server instance comparing Apache and Nginx web servers under various load conditions.
